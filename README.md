# Hello-LX
My very first Github project :)
I am very new to Github, but not to the programming world. I'm not a coder...not just yet. But I am now determined that I want to spend the rest of my career life coding!

I will start with something as simple as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Then I will spice it up a bit with front-end frameworks such as Vue.js or Angular.js -- I haven't quite made up my mind yet. I want to be a full-stack developer, which means I need to learn both frontend and backend languages, although my special interest lies with frontend jobs; seriously? I don't know yet. I am also curious about Ruby and Python, but I perhaps won't start with them until I am comfortable with PHP.
